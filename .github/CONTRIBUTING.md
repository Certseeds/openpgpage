## Submitting a pull request

0. Fork and clone the repository
1. Create a new branch: `git checkout -b my-branch-name`
2. write and commit.
3. Push to your fork and submit a pull request
4. Pat your self on the back and wait for your pull request to be reviewed and merged.

Here are a few things you can do that will increase the likelihood of your pull request being accepted:

- Follow standards for style and code quality,只限于添加或删除自己的内容.
- Keep your change as focused as possible. If there are multiple changes you would like to make that are not dependent upon each other, consider submitting them as separate pull requests.
- Write a [good commit message](http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html).
- Keep one commit for one thing, so we can add changelog easily.
